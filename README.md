## Fred's Vim Configuration
The idea for this was from my friend Dave and others who have posted their Vim configurations.
The packages listed below can be install with Bundler.

## Features
* Project explorer => Nerdtree
* Code completion => YouCompleteMe
* Fuzzy file search => Ctrlp
* Text search => Ack
* Tab bar => Airline
* Git wrapper => Fugitive
* Path based search => Command T

## Usage
* <leader> nt => start Nerdtree

## Installation
#### YouCompleteMe

* Requires Vim 7.3.584
* Requires python2 with dev files (in package manager)
* Requires CMake
* Requires clang for C/C++/Objective C support
* Must run installation script to compile code

#### Airline

* Requires Fugitive for git integration
* Looks better with the installation of Powerline fonts.
